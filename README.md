It would be ideal if either the username or email address can be used for login.
There needs to be a username as there is a requirement for privacy from other users they interact with on the system.
The best way to think of the future system is similar to AirBnB. However, there will be 3 user groups in this system.

Owners, Tenants and Service Providers. Not just 2 (Hosts and Guests) as there is with AirBnB.

The additional items in the profile, (messages, financial history etc) should just show as links on
the user profile at the moment. There will be a requirement in the future to attach messaging and a financial history
to each user in the system. This is a few steps away at the moment.

Also, the next step after creation of the core
user databases and login screen will be developing a simple landing page for while the site is under construction.
The databases you will create must work as a back-end for this landing page to collect user information as required.
The most comparable system to what I am requesting is AirBnB.
